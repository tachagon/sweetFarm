# Information System for Cane Trading Management
### My Senior Project
This is my senior project for group of two people for computer engineering.

### Why this project ?
Thailand is a top agriculture country, which exports the agriculture plants in the world. One of the industrial plant is canes. The reasons that make canesignificant for economy is caneis the main ingredient for sugar and sugar is the ingredient of most foods and drinks. We all consume sugar in our everydaylife. Therefore, caneis imperative. By the way, the canemarket currently not efficient as much as it supposed tobe. This leads exploit problems among canefarmers. Then the canefarmers turn to plant others instead, which leads to reducing of canegoods and effect significantly to the country economic.

Therefore, we would like to develop the communication channel to manage canetrading in the form of a web application to help canefarmer and traders have an opportunity to found each other and make the deal in their desirable price. This communication channel would make the canetrading faster, more efficient, correctly and fairer. The channel composes of users, notification system, offering system, review system and message system.
